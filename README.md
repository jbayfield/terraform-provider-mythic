# Terraform Mythic Beasts Provider

_This template repository is built on the [Terraform Plugin SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk)._

This provider provides tools for interfacing with the [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/) [VPS provisioning API](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/support/api/vps). It is largely written as an experiment in learning Golang and the Terraform SDK. It is not production-ready and should not be used in critical applications. It may (almost definitely) not follow best practices.

_DISCLAIMER: Please note that although at the time of writing I work for Mythic Beasts, this is a project I have written in a personal capacity, in my spare time for enjoyment and learning. It is presented in its existing state with no warranty, express or implied, from either myself, Mythic Beasts Ltd or any related party. Use is at your own risk - no responsibility is accepted for any data loss or impact on your services._
